Conclusion:

" For this assignment, the product profiles that were created did not result in perfect non-collinearity. 
Even though at one instance the correlation between two product attribute was as low as 11%, it was 
not close to 0. This leaves slight room for issues of multicollinearity where preference of one product 
attribute could erroneously show preference of another product attribute.
The preferences of customers seen in terms of part-worths were a little awkward as customers at times 
associated more preference to product levels with lesser objective utility (For example customers 
preferred 5-year warranty much more compared to 5-year warranty + installation and even 5-year 
warranty + installation + upgradeability). This could indicate to a unique kind of customer with an 
unusual customer behavior.
Usually as Price levels increase, the part-worths for them decrease because intuitively customers would 
want a product at the lowest price. However in this case, customers preferred a medium price over the 
lowest price. This could mean that the product profiles made with a medium price were objectively 
more attractive not because of the price but because of the other product attribute levels present in 
them.
An intercept close to zero or negative and all other part-worths negative implied that customers did not 
like the product profile with base levels of product attributes and even more strongly disliked other 
product attribute levels. However these part-worths were calculated on average, meaning there were 
customers that liked a certain product level much more than others which resulted in a higher variance 
of individual part-worths of customers. With such high variance of individual part-worths, this implies 
that either the opinions of customers are objectively very varied throughout the whole customer base in 
the market that it operates, or the customers sampled for the preference survey are not an actual scaled 
representation of the market. To address this, another study can take the approach of better sampling 
methods. "
